## NODE TYPES

The chapters that follow this one specify the node types for the core interface language/model.  They are generated from a "source of truth" which is the actual python source code of `vsc_ast.py`.  This means that while the examples are free-text and may need manual updating, the list of fields and optionality should always match the behavior of the tool(s).  => Always trust the tables over the examples, and report any discrepancies.
